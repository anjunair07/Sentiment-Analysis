Sentiment analysis is an opinion mining process that employs text analysis and opinion categorization to objectively comprehend the writer's perspective on a certain issue or topic.
We will do sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset in this project to ascertain the tweets' sentiments, which can be useful in a variety of situations, such as assessing consumer satisfaction or their thoughts on various
governmental policies.
